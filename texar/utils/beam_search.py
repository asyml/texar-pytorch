    When running, the beam search steps can be visualized by using tfdbg to
    watch the operations generating the output ids for each beam step.
    These operations have the pattern:
        (alive|finished)_topk_(seq,scores)

    Operations marked `alive` represent the new beam sequences that will be
    processed in the next step.    Operations marked `finished` represent
    the completed beam sequences, which may be padded with 0s if no beams
    finished.

    Operations marked `seq` store the full beam sequence for the time step.
    Operations marked `scores` store the sequence's final log scores.

    The beam search steps will be processed sequentially in order, so when
    capturing observed from these operations, tensors, clients can make
    assumptions about which step is being recorded.
